SciGL - creative, I know.

This is just me playing around trying to write a software renderer. I have no idea what I'm doing here.

The code is heavily inspired by [BennyQDBs Software Renderer](https://github.com/BennyQBD/3DSoftwareRenderer) and his [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_vvC2G7vRo&list=PLEETnX-uPtBUbVOok816vTl1K9vV1GgH5).
